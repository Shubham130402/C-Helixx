        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Team C-Helix represents an insight view of our department that has been working in NIT Hamirpur from a long way. NIMBUS, The Techfest of our college allows students from various stream to show their technicality in every field of science. Basically, it’s a student body which explores their creativity and develops meaningful projects. Every year, we make new and innovative projects and show them in an exhibition. Also, we organize certain technical events in which students, as well as teachers, participate to engage their skills and practical knowledge. Educational Workshops and guest lectures are also conducted where students acquire software skills and develop their personality. But as we all know that a happy mind can work better and effective. So, at the end of the Fest, we along with other students take part in the fun event organized by us.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Drip-drop-drip, that’s the constant sound of water drops falling from the tap in your bathroom. As soon as you hear it, you rush to close the tap, because saving water is what we have learned since a young age. But do you know that more than 20% of clean water is wasted even before it reaches your home! 
              The reason? Minute, currently undetectable leaks in the water distribution pipes. 
              
              To get over this issue, this NIMBUS, Team C-Helix brings to you the Pipe Leakage Detection Robot.
              
              Unlike the current systems, this robot can detect extremely small leaks and can also distinguish between leaks and debris. It also works as well in plastic pipes as it does in metal pipes. Where the current systems give a localized area for a possible leak, this robot can give their precise location. This robot uses simple, easily available materials and sensors and can be built at a very low cost.
              
              The robot can squeeze itself into a range of different pipe systems. On top of that, instead of requiring a motor to push or steer it, it moves with the water flow. Further, saving costs and reducing complexity..</p>

A very common scenario you might have faced there is the continuous coughing of people. The never-ending dust and impurities present in the air are the cause for it. What we get as a result of this are around 10million deaths every year. so to tackle this problem Team C-Helix this nimbus presents to all of you AIR PURIFIER.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">The AUREUS system is an evolution for walls/windows and uses technology synthesized from upcycled crop waste to absorb stray UV light from sunlight and convert it to clean renewable electricity. the composition uses for the AUREUS system comprising photo-luminescent elements that absorb UV radiation and emit longer wavelength nonultraviolet radiation. Photo-luminescent elements are dispersed on or in a material that may be a transparent film. IT champions the issues of UV sequestration, better access to solar energy for climate change mitigation, and supporting the local agriculture industry hit by calamities by upcycling crops that would otherwise be considered wastes thus, mitigating farmer loss and provides a better environment.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Solar energy is one of the leading renewable energy sources. Due to its clean and emission free nature, it is widely harvested all over the world. However, solar power is hampered by its inability to efficiently generate electricity in overcast or rainy conditions. To get over this problem, Team C-Helix brings to you an energy harvesting model with hybrid solar panels that are functional not only under sunlight but also under rainy conditions. Assuming the compelling features, such as cost-effectiveness and a greatly expanded working time, the hybrid system renders an innovative way to realize multiple kinds of energy harvesting in a single model and as a useful compensation to the currently widely used photovoltaic (PV) panels.</p>
